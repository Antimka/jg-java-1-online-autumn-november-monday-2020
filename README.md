## Certificate of Completion

A Certificate of Completion will be issued to students upon their successful fulfilment of course requirements. To have successfully completed a course means the student has passed the **beginner** course assessment.

## Homework Submission Workflow

It is required to submit a solved assignment exercises and problems throughout the course in order to receive a certificate of completion.
Since a repository shared between students, please refer to the following homework submission workflow.

**Initial** steps to take (should be done **once per course** ⚠️):
1. `VCS > Update Project > Merge incoming changes in the current branch` - to make sure your project is up-to-date with repository
2. `VCS > Git > Branches... > + New Branch` with branch name `student-name-surname`, e.g. `student-ivans-ivanovs` - to create your personal working branch

👉 After that, please create your own **package** `name_surname`, e.g. `ivans_ivanovs`, in the `src/main/java/students` folder.
To create a package, right click on the *java* folder and select `New > Package`.

**Subsequent** steps to take (should be done **before every submission** ⚠️):
1. `VCS > Update Project > Merge incoming changes into the current branch`
2. `VCS > Git > Branches... > Local Branches: Master > Update`
3. `VCS > Git > Branches... > Local Branches: Master > Merge into current`

👉 After that, in your own package, create package after lesson name and level `lesson_n/level_n/task_n`, e.g. `lesson_2/level_1/task_1`. Create text files or java classes with solution as needed.

4. `VCS > Commit > Commit and Push...`

## Homework Review Workflow

Each solution reviewed personally and is either accepted or rejected.

* The comments will appear if there are any remarks or suggestions
* Homework evaluation will be visible at the top of a document with comment:
  * `//Resolution: ACCEPTED` - In case solution accepted
  * `//Resolution: SEEN` - In case solution rejected and requires additional improvements or fixes
